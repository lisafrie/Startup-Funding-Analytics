# CIS-5500-Project - Startup Funding Analytics

## Project Summary

The success of a business venture is a reason for founders and investors to feel proud. Both entrepreneurs and investors are constantly looking for resources, strategies, and guidance that will put them ahead of their rivals. It is questionable whether having certain inherent skills is a prerequisite for success as an entrepreneur or if those skills can be learned (e.g. through formal business education). Innovative teams and leaders in market research rely on Crunchbaseâ€™s private company data to build powerful internal databases and research insights in respective industries. Furthermore, it is highly challenging to gauge the importance of external factors like the sector a firm competes in, the region where its headquarters are, or the amount of rivalry in a specific sector and its sub sectors.

As our application develops, observe and detect market patterns. Our worldwide coverage of businesses at all stages, from pre-seed to late-stage, allows you to see how much money companies in a particular field are raising and who are the top players in specific industries. Receive suggestions and updates delivered to you regularly depending upon your activity.
